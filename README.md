`remix-vite` helps you serve [Remix](https://remix.run/) apps locally using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Usage

The quickest way to get started is to just run `npx remix-vite` in your project's directory.

If you prefer, you can also install the package globally (you'll need at least [Node LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule)):

```bash
> npm install --global remix-vite
```

Once that's done, you can run this command inside your project's directory...

```bash
> remix-vite
```

Now you understand how the package works! :tada:
